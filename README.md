# covidchatbot

In this project I'd like to make a responsive chat bot, similar to the one used in NSW after covid tests, with the following requirements: 

Interacts with client in a conversational manner to obtain their name, birthdate, address, phone number, date of test

Stores history of tests in a file locally, with test result status

Ability to lookup test entry and enter test result/delete entry
